## Introduction
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the data science community. It contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their age, gender, class, ticket fare, and survival status. The primary objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to better understand the characteristics of passengers and explore the factors that played a role in their survival.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including various attributes such as:
- Passenger class
- Age
- Gender
- Fare
- Embarkation point
- Survival status

## Exploratory Data Analysis
During the EDA process, I've undertaken the following steps:
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Visualizing passenger demographics (age, gender, class)
- Analyzing survival rates based on different factors (age, class, gender)
- Exploring relationships between attributes (correlations)
- Investigating fare distribution and its relation to survival

## Usage
To explore the insights gained from this EDA or to use the provided analysis techniques for your own projects, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Navigate to the Jupyter Notebook files to view the EDA process.
